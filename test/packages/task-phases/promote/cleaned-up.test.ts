/**
 * Command-level system tests for `pnpm task promote [--json]` performing the
 * final cleanup once the task's Main Gate PR is confirmed merged
 * (task-MAG-46-15-status-merged-pending-cleanup-and-promote-cleaned-up-
 * spec.md, LLD §3.6).
 *
 * Five behaviors under test, kept separate per §3.3–§3.6 (plus §2.1's
 * convergence requirement):
 *   1. `merged-pending-cleanup` (regular route) -> cleanup: checkout `main`,
 *      update local `main` to match `origin/main`, delete
 *      `spec/test/build/ready` branches, NO confirmation required,
 *      `action: "cleaned-up"`, `branchesDeleted` contains all four,
 *      exit 0 (§3.3).
 *   2. §2.1 convergence: the interrupted-cleanup retrigger fixture (no PR
 *      found, a surviving branch already an ancestor of `main`) resolves to
 *      the SAME `cleaned-up` action and the same `branchesDeleted` as the
 *      ordinary route — one code path, not two that happen to look similar.
 *   3. Partially-already-deleted branches: `deleteBranch("test/{ref}")` is
 *      still called and tolerates "doesn't exist" as a no-op — cleanup
 *      succeeds with only some of spec/test/build/ready surviving, `action`
 *      still `"cleaned-up"`, exit 0 (§3.4).
 *   4. After cleanup the ref reports `not-initialised` again (§3.5 — a
 *      trailing side-effect verification of the cleanup, so it stays in this
 *      file rather than moving to the status file, per the test-file-layout
 *      doc §4's exception).
 *   5. The quick route deletes only `task/{ref}`: `branchesDeleted` is
 *      exactly `["task/AAA-234"]`, and `deleteBranch` is never called with a
 *      spec/test/build branch that the route never created (§3.6).
 *
 * **Correction (architect fix, build-phase review, ahead of merge):** the
 * regular route's Main Gate PR pair is `ready/{ref}` -> `main`, not
 * `build/{ref}` -> `main` — same fix, same reason, as
 * `status/merged-pending-cleanup.test.ts`'s own correction note (caught via
 * a real e2e fixture using the actual branch pattern every real Main Gate
 * PR in this project uses). Fixed `findMergedPR` mocks/assertions from
 * `("main", "build/{ref}")` to `("main", "ready/{ref}")`;
 * `deleteBranch`/`branchesDeleted` targets are unaffected — `build/{ref}`
 * remains the correct branch to actually delete, this only changes which
 * branch the merged-PR *lookup* checks.
 *
 * **Correction (architect fix, MAG-46 close-out, post-merge):** the
 * regular-route `branchesToDelete` list predates the `build/{ref}` ->
 * `ready/{ref}` rename and never picked up `ready/{ref}` itself — the Main
 * Gate PR's actual (transient) head branch, left behind every single cycle
 * and requiring a manual `git push origin --delete` each time (confirmed by
 * dogfooding this exact command against MAG-46 itself across all 18 of its
 * own chunks). `ready/{ref}` added to the regular-route branch set; the
 * quick route is unaffected (it never creates a `ready/{ref}`).
 *
 * §2.1 contracts asserted explicitly:
 *   - `promote` consumes the shared `deriveRepoState()` pipeline — it never
 *     re-checks the merged/ancestor conditions itself (the merged Main Gate
 *     PR is consulted via `findMergedPR`, the retrigger via `isAncestor`).
 *   - No `--confirm-rebase` flag (or any prompt) gates this action — nothing
 *     is lost once the merge is confirmed, unlike MAG-46-14's cascading
 *     rewrite.
 *   - `git.isDirty()` is consulted before cleanup proceeds (a Given in every
 *     §3.3/§3.4/§3.6 fixture).
 *   - The cleanup sequence follows LLD §3.6: checkout `main` first, then
 *     update it, then delete the branches.
 *
 * Same in-process pattern as every prior chunk: `run(argv, tools)` is
 * called directly with an injected `ExternalTools` whose `git`/`github`/
 * `gateChecks` members are test doubles — no real git/gh/fs/gate-check
 * anywhere. The derivation fixture mirrors `status/merged-pending-cleanup
 * .test.ts`'s (MAG-46-15): a confirmed-merged Main Gate PR
 * (`main` <- `build/{ref}`) with local `main` not yet caught up (the
 * `isAncestor` confirmation returns `false`), or, for the retrigger, no PR
 * at all with a surviving branch already an ancestor of local `main`. The
 * caller sits on the derived phase's canonical branch (`build/{ref}`, or
 * `task/{ref}` on the quick route) so LLD §3.4's `branchMismatch` guard
 * passes. Mutating git methods a scenario must NOT reach (`push`/`rebase`/
 * `createBranch`/`createRemoteBranch`/`commitAll` everywhere) are
 * throw-mocks, so "no action" is enforced structurally, not merely
 * asserted. `isDirty` resolves `false`; the mutating primitives under test
 * (`checkout`/`pullFastForward`/`deleteBranch`) are resolving doubles.
 *
 * Every one of these tests fails against the pre-implementation codebase:
 * `promote` currently only implements the fork, rebase-forward, pr-raised,
 * awaiting-pr no-op, blocked-relay, and merged-pending-pull paths
 * (commands/promote.ts); a `merged-pending-cleanup` derivation falls
 * through to `new Error("not implemented")`. None of the scenarios can
 * produce `action: "cleaned-up"` — or the branch deletions it entails —
 * yet. §3.5 additionally fails because the post-cleanup `status` read has
 * no real cleanup having happened to leave no branches behind.
