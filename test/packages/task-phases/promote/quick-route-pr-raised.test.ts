/**
 * Command-level system tests for `pnpm task promote [--json]`'s quick-route
 * `ready -> pr-raised` action — raising the Main Gate PR directly
 * (`task/{ref}` -> `main`) and the `awaiting-pr` no-op
 * (task-MAG-46-11-01-promote-quick-route-pr-raised-spec.md, LLD §3.11).
 *
 * This closes the gap MAG-46-11 left open: that chunk only proved the
 * test-phase PR-raise (`test/{ref}` -> `build/{ref}`); the quick route's
 * own promote-to-PR action had no spec at all. `promote` here operates on
 * `phase: "quick"` (canonical branch `task/{ref}`) — NOT `phase: "build"`
 * — even though the destination gate name is the same string
 * ("main-gate") as the regular route's final gate (§2.1: don't conflate
 * the two phases just because the gate name matches).
 *
 * Four behaviors under test, separated per §3 (the fourth, WVR-61's
 * `[title] [message]` positional args, isn't part of the original §3 spec
 * — it's a later addition, same relationship `push` (WVR-60) has to §3.1):
 *   1. Finding `task/{ref}` resolved `ready` (via `resolveReady()`), the
 *      quick route's `promote` raises the Main Gate PR through
 *      `github.createPR("main", "task/{ref}", ...)` and reports
 *      `action: "pr-raised"` with the PR's number/url (§3.1). Unlike the
 *      test-phase route, NO branch-publish precedes the PR: the base
 *      `main` already exists, so `git.createRemoteBranch`/
 *      `createBranch`/`checkout` are never touched.
 *   2. Finding `task/{ref}` `blocked`, `promote` takes no git action and
 *      relays `main-gate`'s own violations verbatim (§3.2) — same
 *      treatment as every other blocked case, just against `main-gate`
 *      instead of `test-gate`/`build-gate`.
 *   3. Once that Main Gate PR is open (`awaiting-pr` on the `quick`
 *      phase), a repeated `promote` call is the same safe, idempotent
 *      no-op as the test-phase case: `action: "none"`,
 *      `github.createPR` NOT called again, the reported message re-states
 *      the existing PR's number (§3.3).
 *   4. `promote [title] [message]`, mirroring `wip`'s convention: with
 *      neither, the PR title/body fall back to a generic
 *      `{ref}: Promote to ...` description; with a title only, the title
 *      becomes `{ref}: {title}` and the body stays generic; with both,
 *      the body is `message` verbatim (WVR-61) — the caller (human or
 *      agent, via the opencode tool wrapper's raw `args` passthrough)
 *      supplying real context beats any template.
 *
 * Same in-process pattern as every prior chunk: `run(argv, tools)` is
 * called directly with an injected `ExternalTools` whose `git`/`github`/
 * `gateChecks` members are test doubles — no real git/gh/fs/gate-check
 * anywhere. `git.currentBranch` returns `task/AAA-234` (the quick route's
 * canonical branch); `branchExists` reports exactly `task/AAA-234`
 * existing; `hasCommitsBeyond("task/AAA-234", "main")` resolves `true`
 * (the ready? precondition), `isAncestor("origin/main", "task/AAA-234")`
 * resolves `true` (no trunk-drift rebase trigger), and `gateChecks.run`
 * resolves a passing `main-gate`. `github.findOpenPR("main",
 * "task/AAA-234")` is stateful so the post-createPR re-derivation reports
 * `awaiting-pr` rather than re-raising; `git.createRemoteBranch`/
 * `createBranch`/`checkout` are throw-mocks — the quick route publishes
 * no *base* branch and forks nothing. `push` (WVR-60) is a real mock: the
 * *head* branch (`task/{ref}`) is pushed unconditionally before the PR is
 * raised.
 *
 * Every one of these tests fails against the pre-implementation codebase:
 * `promote` only implements the spec-spec fork (`action: "forked"`), the
 * test-phase Build Gate raise (`action: "pr-raised"`), and the blocked
 * relay — a `quick`-phase `ready` falls through to `new Error("not
 * implemented")` (commands/promote.ts). On the `awaiting-pr` side,
 * `deriveRepoState`'s `assertNoGatePR`/`derivePrState` (lib/repo-state.ts)
 * still throws `"not implemented"` the moment an open PR is found on any
 * pair other than the Build Gate pair, so the quick route's open Main Gate
 * PR cannot yet produce `phase: "quick", state: "awaiting-pr"` (or the
 * §3.3 no-op that re-states its number). None of the three scenarios can
 * produce `action: "pr-raised"` — or a "none" that re-states a Main Gate
 * PR — yet.
 *
 * **Correction (MAG-50):** §3.2's blocked case originally asserted exit 0 /
 * `success: true`. Corrected: `promote`'s whole job is to promote — a
 * `blocked` state means that did not happen, so it's a failed invocation
 * (exit 1 / `success: false`) even though no systematic error occurred
 * determining it. No git-action or violation-relay behavior changed.
