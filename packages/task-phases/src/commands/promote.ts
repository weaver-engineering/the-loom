/**
 * `pnpm task promote [--json]` — see task-phasing-lld.md §3.11. This chunk
 * (MAG-46-14) implements the `merged-pending-pull` resolution: the Build
 * Gate PR merged but local `build/{ref}` doesn't yet reflect it (derived in
 * MAG-46-12), so `promote` either plain-pulls it (no local `build/{ref}` —
 * `action: "pulled"`, no confirmation, §3.1) or pulls AND rebases the
 * pre-existing build commits onto the fresh merge (`action:
 * "pulled-and-rebased"`, gated by `--confirm-rebase` or an interactive y/N
 * prompt, §3.2/§3.6), surfacing conflicts / unexpected commit counts via
 * `rebaseOutcome` rather than silently resolving them (§3.4/§3.5).
 *
 * Earlier chunks: MAG-46-10 implemented the first real `promote` action:
 * finding `spec/{ref}` resolved `ready` (via `resolveReady()`, called
 * **unconditionally** — unlike `status`, which only resolves with `--check`),
 * create `test/{ref}` off `spec/{ref}` and return the worktree to
 * `spec/{ref}` (LLD §2.1's branch-restoration invariant — its first
 * application). Finding `spec/{ref}` `blocked`, take no git action and relay
 * the gate's own violations verbatim. The `branchMismatch` guard (LLD §3.4)
 * is evaluated on entry and refuses outright when `currentBranch !=
 * canonicalBranch`. Every other derived state (not-started / work-in-progress
 * / awaiting-pr / merged-pending-* / the test->build and build->main hops)
 * belongs to later chunks and defers.
 *
 * MAG-49 (this chunk) closes the last remaining ready hop — the
 * `build::ready -> pr-raised` action named by the fallthrough comment below:
 * once local `build/{ref}` resolves `ready` (the build gate passes against
 * the local worktree's own commits, no push first), create `ready/{ref}`
 * from `build/{ref}`'s HEAD, push it, raise the Main Gate PR
 * (`ready/{ref}` -> `main`), and restore the starting branch. Modeled on
 * `quick::ready -> pr-raised` (its destination `main` always exists) plus
 * the one step neither template needs: creating `ready/{ref}` itself. A
 * pre-existing `origin/ready/{ref}` is either a safe-to-discard stale
 * attempt (deleted, then recreated fresh) or already-merged history
 * (refused cleanly — never silently overwritten). Trunk drift on the build
 * phase and a `blocked` build-phase gate need no new code: the generic
 * rebase-forward block and the generic blocked-relay branch (both below)
 * already cover `build` unchanged.
 *
 * The phase/state/canonicalBranch/branchMismatch derivation is
 * `deriveRepoState()` from `lib/repo-state.ts` — the same function `status`
 * calls, not a private re-derivation — and `ready?` resolution is
 * `resolveReady()`, not a direct `gateChecks.run` call.
